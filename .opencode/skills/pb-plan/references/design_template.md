## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 System Context

> How does this feature fit into the existing system? Describe interactions with other modules, services, or external systems. Use a diagram if helpful.

### 3.2 Key Design Principles

> Core ideas guiding this design. Examples: "Separation of concerns", "Fail-fast", "Backward-compatible API".

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1 Module Structure

> File/directory layout for the new or modified code.

```
src/
├── module_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── core.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── utils.py
```

### 4.2 Data Structures & Types

> Define core data models, classes, enums, or schemas.

```
# Example pseudo-code — adapt to project language
class FeatureConfig:
    enabled: bool
    max_retries: int
    timeout_seconds: float

class FeatureState:
    IDLE = "idle"
    RUNNING = "running"
    ERROR = "error"
```

### 4.3 Interface Design

> Public APIs, function signatures, abstract interfaces, or protocols this feature exposes or consumes.

```
class FeatureInterface:
    def execute(input: InputType) -> OutputType:
        """Describe purpose and contract."""
        ...
```

### 4.4 Logic Flow

> Describe key workflows, state transitions, or processing pipelines. Use step-by-step descriptions or diagrams.

### 4.5 Configuration

> Any new config values, environment variables, or feature flags introduced.

### 4.6 Error Handling

> Error types, failure modes, and recovery strategy.

---

## 5. Verification & Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Unit Testing

> What pure logic to test. Scope and tooling.

### 5.2 Integration Testing

> How modules work together. Mock strategies, sandbox environments.

### 5.3 Validation Rules

| Test Case ID | Action | Expected Outcome | Verification Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-01** | [Action] | [Expected result] | [How to verify] |
| **TC-02** | [Action] | [Expected result] | [How to verify] |
| **TC-03** | [Action] | [Expected result] | [How to verify] |

## 6. Implementation Plan

> Phase checklist — high-level roadmap mapping to tasks.md.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation** — Scaffolding, config, core types
- [ ] **Phase 2: Core Logic** — Primary feature implementation
- [ ] **Phase 3: Integration** — Wire into existing system, end-to-end flow
- [ ] **Phase 4: Polish** — Tests, docs, error handling, CI

---

## 7. Cross-Functional Concerns

> Security review, backward compatibility, migration plan, documentation updates, monitoring/alerting, or rollback strategy — if applicable.
